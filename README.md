## 📘 Project Overview

**Title:** Intelligent Pesticide Sprinkling Determined by the Infection Level of a Plant  
**Theme:** Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development  
**Team Name:** Volt Visionaries  
**Category:** Hardware

---

## 💡 Idea Summary

**Plant Doctor** is an IoT-based smart agriculture solution that helps farmers identify crop infections in real-time using **sensors** and **AI-based analysis**.  
It determines infection severity and controls pesticide spraying automatically — reducing chemical usage, saving resources, and protecting crops.

## ⚙️ Technical Approach

### 🧠 Programming & Tools
- **Arduino IDE (ESP32)** – for embedded control and sensor integration  
- **MATLAB** – for data analysis, graph plotting, and infection visualization  
- **Python (optional extension)** – for ML-based decision logic and dashboard integration  

### 🔩 Hardware Components
| Component | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| **ESP32 / ESP32-S3 Nano** | Central controller and communication |
| **Camera Module** | Captures plant leaf images for infection detection |
| **TCS3200 Color Sensor** | Analyzes leaf color for stress levels |
| **MQ-135 Gas Sensor** | Detects harmful gases (plant stress indicator) |
| **Relay Module + 5V DC Pump** | Controls pesticide spraying mechanism |
| **Breadboard, Jumper Wires, Batteries** | Circuit prototyping and power supply |
